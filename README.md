# Long Binh Metro Depot Simulation

This is a personal project recreating the **Long Binh Metro Depot** (Vietnam) in Roblox, designed and developed by **Quyy**.

> ⚙️ All 3D models (train, structure, mechanical parts, even fire extinguishers) are fully handmade in Blender.  
> 💻 All scripts were written manually from scratch.

## 📍 Real-World Reference

The Long Binh Depot is the main maintenance facility of Ho Chi Minh City's Metro Line 1. It includes:

- **Train sheds** and inspection pits  
- **Overhead wire structures** (for 1.5–2kV DC power supply)  
- **Maintenance platforms** and walkways  
- **Fire safety systems** and control rooms  
- **Buffer stops** to prevent overrun  
- **Platform screen doors** for safe boarding  
- **Train lifting mechanisms** (cranes, hoisting cables, etc.)

## 🛠️ In-Game Implementation

This Roblox version faithfully replicates the real-life depot with high detail and accuracy, including:

### ✅ Built Using:
- **Blender** (for all mesh modeling)
- **Roblox Studio** (game engine and integration)
- **Lua Scripting** (for interactivity, train control, fly systems)

### 🧱 Features:
- Fully modeled **metro trains**
- Realistic **steel walkways and grid platforms**
- **Functional buffer stops** to limit train movement
- **Fire extinguisher cabinets** and industrial props
- Overhead **catenary structures** with power supports
- **Mechanical systems** to simulate depot equipment
- A modular setup that can be expanded for further detail
